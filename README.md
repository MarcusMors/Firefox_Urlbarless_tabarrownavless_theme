## How to use it

1. Go to `about:config`
2. Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`
3. Go to your firefox profile folder (go to `about:support` on firefox and click `open directory` in the profile column
4. Go to the `chrome` directory, inside of it copy or create the contents from `userChrome.css` in this repository into a file with the same name.
5. Restart your firefox (close and open it).


Note: everytime you make a change in userChrome.css, you should do step 5 to show the changes. You can add or try other tweaks or modifications with the links in the [resources section](###Resources).


### Resources (they are already in the userchrome.css but i'll add them here anyway):
